This is a Ruby controller for a Presto Pizzazz countertop pizza oven that has been modified and has its heater controlled by an Automation Direct SOLO-4824 temperature controller.

The Ruby program controls the temperature controller via Modbus/RTU over RS-485.

A webserver is available to see the temperature performance.
